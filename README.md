This is a simple and clean weather web app I built to show real-time weather updates for any city.
I created it to practice working with APIs, responsive UI, and improve my JavaScript logic.

The app gives users access to temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions — all in one view. I focused on building a modern look that feels smooth, fast, and easy to use.
